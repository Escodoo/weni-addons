To use the ``mis_cash_flow_forecast_line`` module, follow the steps below:

1. **Module installation**: First, you need to install the module in your Odoo environment. This can be done by either copying the module to your Odoo module folder or installing it from the Odoo module management application.

2. **Module configuration**: As the module extends the functionality of the ``mis.cash_flow.forecast_line`` model, it is important to ensure that the main module is properly configured. Follow the configuration steps of the main module to set up the cash flow forecast, report templates, and related KPIs.

3. **Using the additional fields**: In the ``mis.cash_flow.forecast_line`` model, you will find the additional fields ``res_id``, ``res_model_id``, ``parent_res_id``, ``parent_res_model_id``, and ``analytic_account_id``. These fields can be used to associate related records and their parent information with the cash flow forecast.

   - When creating or editing a cash flow forecast record, select the related record and the parent record in the respective reference field, and also select the related analytic account.

4. **Accessing related and parent records**: After configuring the additional fields, you can use the `action_open_document_related` and `action_open_parent_document_related` methods to directly access the related records and their parent records.

   - While browsing through the cash flow forecast records, you can perform the `action_open_document_related` action to open the view of the related record in Odoo. If the `res_model` and `res_id` fields are empty, the method will return `False`.

   - Similarly, you can perform the `action_open_parent_document_related` action to open the view of the related parent record in Odoo. If the `parent_res_model` and `parent_res_id` fields are empty, the method will return `False`.

With this, you will be able to use the `mis_cash_flow_forecast_line` module to associate records and their parent information with cash flow forecasts and access them directly from the cash flow forecast records. Additionally, you will be able to associate analytic accounts with cash flow forecasts.
