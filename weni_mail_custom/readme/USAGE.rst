To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to Odoo's settings and navigate to the "Technical" section.
#. Under the "Email" category, select "Aliases."
#. Create or edit an existing mail alias.
#. In the mail alias form, you should find a field named "Whitelist Words." Here, you can enter comma-separated words that you want to use for filtering emails.
#. If you want to disable the mail filtering with whitelist words for the specific mail alias, make sure the "Whitelist Words" field is empty.
#. When you receive an email at the alias address, the module checks the body of the email for the presence of any words specified in the "Whitelist Words."
